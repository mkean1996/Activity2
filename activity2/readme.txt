I made some mistakes this project as I assumed to test the website I had to upload it to github, as a 
result there are multiple commits that didn't need to happen, I will endeavour to explain each of them and
their reasoning behind each. 

Commit 1) My initial commit after placing the first html file.
Commit 2) My second commit, having a basic css file and edited the first html file.
Commit 3) This commit was dedicated to trying to get the css file to work.
Commit 4) Fourth pass at trying to get the wrapper to work, beginning to suspect something might be wrong with the code.
Commit 5) Found the issue with the code.
Commits 6&7) Established after these two that it was not neccesary to commit changes in order to test. 
Commit 8) Final commit, everything is in order and fairly well established, hopefully good enough! I am happy with the work.
