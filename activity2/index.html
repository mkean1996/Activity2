<h1>Michael Kean's Basic Site</h1>
<p>I'm afraid it has been much time since I have touched up on my HTML and CSS,
as it was my first year of school when I took the class. My knowledge of this is
fairly basic, but I am trying to better myself in order to make sites like this
look and feel more smooth. I also have practiced with the following languages; Java, Oracle SQL, and C. I want to pursue a career in the technical field, but have
yet to make a final decision.</p>

<p>I am a fifth year senior, as odd as that sounds - this is so that I can get a minor
in both cybersecurity and economics. My father had a similar certificate, and it's
what inspired me to pursue that field. I play a variety of board games with my siblings
and friends, video games (which were once far more prevelant for me) are a simple pass time.
I currently work at Methodist Hospital as a pharmacy technician on a casual basis (being about 15-20
hours a week), and am taking plenty of courses to fill the spare time. </p>
