        <p> I'm afraid it has been much time since I have touched up on my HTML and CSS,
            as it was my first year of school when I took the class. My knowledge of this is
            fairly basic, but I am trying to better myself in order to make sites like this
            look and feel more smooth. I also have practiced with the following languages; Java, Oracle SQL, and C. I want to pursue a career in the technical field, but have
            yet to make a final decision.

         <p>I am a fifth year senior, as odd as that sounds - this is so that I can get a minor
             in both cybersecurity and economics. My father had a similar certificate, and it's
             what inspired me to pursue that field. I play a variety of board games with my siblings
             and friends, video games (which were once far more prevelant for me) are a simple pass time.
             I currently work at Methodist Hospital as a pharmacy technician on a casual basis (being about 15-20
             hours a week), and am taking plenty of courses to fill the spare time.
